• Designed a Java program to convert infix expressions to postfiix and evaluate postfix expression using a custom stack implementation
• Applied data structures, algorithm design, and error handling for edge cases.
• Developed methods to handle complex arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) while validating input and
detecting errors (e.g. unmatched parentheses, square brackets, and curly brases).
• Built and tested a generic stack data structures for expression parsing and evaluation.
